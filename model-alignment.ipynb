Summary: ; text={The Vietnam War, a protracted and divisive conflict that lasted from 1955 to 1975, pitted the communist government of North Vietnam, backed by the Soviet Union and China, against the U.S.-supported South Vietnam. The war's roots lay in France's withdrawal from Indochina in 1954, which divided Vietnam into two separate nations. North Vietnam, led by Ho Chi Minh, sought to unify the country under communist rule, while South Vietnam, headed by Ngo Dinh Diem, resisted this effort. The United States, fearing the spread of communism in Southeast Asia, gradually increased its involvement in South Vietnam, culminating in the deployment of ground troops in 1965. The war became a protracted and bloody stalemate, with both sides suffering heavy casualties. The Tet Offensive of 1968, a major North Vietnamese offensive, marked a turning point in the war, eroding public support in the United States and prompting calls for withdrawal. After years of negotiations, the Paris Peace Accords were signed in 1973, leading to the withdrawal of U.S. troops. However, the war continued between North and South Vietnam, and in 1975, North Vietnamese forces captured Saigon, unifying the country under communist rule. The Vietnam War left a profound impact on Vietnam, the United States, and the world, with its legacy of violence, trauma, and political upheaval continuing to resonate today.} Summary:\n",

Accompanied by a fellowship of loyal companions, Frodo faces formidable foes and grapples with the corrupting influence of the Ring itself. Amidst the escalating conflict, the fellowship's unity crumbles, and Frodo continues his journey alone, guided by his faithful companion Samwise Gamgee. In a climactic confrontation at Mount Doom, Frodo succumbs to the Ring's temptation, but Gollum, the tormented creature who previously possessed the Ring, severs Frodo's finger, claiming the Ring for himself. Consumed by the Ring's power, Gollum falls into the molten lava, destroying the Ring and himself.
